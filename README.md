<h2>üì∞ About Project</h2>

The initial idea is the Develop a SPA application for listing, filtering and opening news profiles from the API of your choice (see suggestions below). The application must list the first 100 records of the entity and organize it in a clickable list, allowing you to filter based on the existing fields of the entity. After the listing, it should be possible to click on one of the items in the list and render the content of the article within the APP itself. You are free to choose the best way to display this content.
